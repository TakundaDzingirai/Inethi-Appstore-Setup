## How to Set Up and Run the Inethi App Store Docker Server

### Step 1: Place Your APK Files

1. **Locate the `repo` folder in your project directory.**
2. **Place all your APK files in the `repo` folder.**
   
   Ensure that each APK file has a corresponding icon image in the `static/icons` directory with the same name (e.g., `AlphabetBook.apk` should have an icon named `AlphabetBook.apk.png`).

### Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Container

1. **Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory** where your `Dockerfile` is located.
   
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project

   ```
   then run this 'docker-compose up -d'    // this command is equavalent to step 2 and 3 so there is no need to run step 2 and 3 

   ```
for alternative approach run step 2 and 3 
for alternative approach run step 2 and 3 

2. **Build the Docker image** by running the following command:
   
   ```
   docker build -t inethi_appstore_image .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container** with the newly built image:
   
   ```
   docker run -d --name inethi_appstore -p 81:81 -p 5000:5000 inethi_appstore_image
   ```

### Summary of Commands

```bash
docker build -t inethi_appstore_image .
docker run -d --name inethi_appstore -p 81:81 -p 5000:5000 inethi_appstore_image
```

### Notes

- The `-t` option in the `docker build` command tags the image with the name `inethi_appstore_image`.
- The `-d` option in the `docker run` command runs the container in detached mode.
- The `--name` option names the running container `inethi_appstore`.
- The `-p` option maps the host ports to the container ports. Port 81 is used for Nginx, and port 5000 is used for the Flask application.
